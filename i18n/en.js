  frenchBulldogBreedText1: 'The French Bulldog is a companion dog. The breed is small and muscular with heavy bone structure, a smooth coat, a short face and trademark “bat” ears. Prized for its affectionate nature and balanced disposition, they are generally active and alert, but not unduly boisterous.',
  frenchBulldogBreedText2: 'Children friendly',
  frenchBulldogBreedText3: 'Frenchies get along well with children, and they\'re not so tiny that they can\'t live in a household with a toddler.',
  frenchBulldogBreedText4: 'Hate to be alone',
  frenchBulldogBreedText5: 'If you want an outdoor dog who can be left alone for long periods, the Frenchie is not the breed for you.',
  frenchBulldogBreedText6: 'Excellent housekeeper',
  frenchBulldogBreedText7: 'French Bulldogs make excellent watchdogs and will alert their people to approaching strangers, but it\'s not their style to bark without cause.',
  frenchBulldogBreedText8: 'Excercise disliked',
  frenchBulldogBreedText9: 'French Bulldogs do not need a lot of exercise, but they do need daily walks to keep them at a healthy weight.',
  frenchBulldogBreedText10: 'Personality',
  frenchBulldogBreedText11: 'This is a smart, loving dog who wants and needs to spend lots of time with his people. A fun-loving freethinker, the French Bulldog takes well to training when it’s done in a positive manner with lots of food rewards, praise, and play.',
  frenchBulldogBreedText12: 'Care',
  frenchBulldogBreedText13: 'French Bulldogs do not need a lot of exercise. They have fairly low energy levels, although there are exceptions to every rule. To keep their weight down, however, they need daily exercise through short walks or play times in the yard. Many French Bulldogs enjoy playing and will spend much of their time in various activities, but they are not so high energy that they need a large yard or long periods of exercise.',
  frenchBulldogBreedText14: 'Feeding',
  frenchBulldogBreedText15: 'Recommended daily amount: 1 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.',
  frenchBulldogBreedText16: 'Grooming',
  frenchBulldogBreedText17: 'French Bulldogs are fairly easy to groom and need only an occasional brushing to keep their coat healthy. They are average shedders. Begin grooming your Frenchie at a young age and teach your puppy to stand on a table or floor to make this experience easier on both of you.',

  dachshundBreedText1: 'The Dachshund is not just a dog; he is a true personality. Originating from Germany and originally bred for badger hunting, this breed possesses self-assurance and courage that far exceed its physical size.',
  dachshundBreedText2: 'Big heart in a small body',
  dachshundBreedText3: 'Dachshunds are very loyal to their families, but due to their size and long backs, they require caution. They are recommended for older children who already know how to handle them properly to avoid spinal injuries.',
  dachshundBreedText4: 'They do not like being alone',
  dachshundBreedText5: 'They are extremely people-oriented dogs who follow their owners like a shadow. If left alone for too long, separation anxiety may occur, manifesting in digging or chewing. They need companionship.',
  dachshundBreedText6: 'Excellent watchdog',
  dachshundBreedText7: 'Despite their small size, the courage of Dachshunds is boundless. They are very alert and signal any suspicious noise or stranger with a loud, deep bark. They are excellent sentries who take the protection of their territory seriously.',
  dachshundBreedText8: 'They require exercise',
  dachshundBreedText9: 'Unlike Bulldogs, Dachshunds are more active. Driven by their hunting instinct, they need daily walks and mental stimulation (such as snuffle mats) to prevent destructive behavior or obesity.',
  dachshundBreedText10: 'Personality',
  dachshundBreedText11: 'Smart and independent, but do not expect military obedience. Since they were bred as earth dogs to make decisions alone underground, they sometimes have selective hearing. They can only be persuaded to cooperate with patience, praise, and – most importantly – many tasty treats.',
  dachshundBreedText12: 'Care',
  dachshundBreedText13: 'The most important thing is protecting their back: climbing stairs and jumping from heights should be avoided. Due to their low stature, they are prone to weight gain, which puts extra strain on the spine, so regular but non-strenuous exercise is essential.',
  dachshundBreedText14: 'Feeding',
  dachshundBreedText15: 'Recommended daily amount: 0.5–1.5 cups of high-quality dry food (depending on size) per day, divided into two meals. Weight control is crucial because even half a kilo of excess weight can strain their joints.',
  dachshundBreedText16: 'Grooming',
  dachshundBreedText17: 'Their grooming depends on the coat type. Smooth-haired ones only need brushing once a week, while long-haired and wire-haired varieties require more care (combing, stripping). It is worth getting them used to nail trimming and tooth brushing from a young age.',
